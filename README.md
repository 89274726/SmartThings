SmartThings 
My experimental SmartThings Device Handler for the new 4 button Scene Switches 'Powered by Tuya'
Tested in SmartThings platform using ABC Manager app
Actually is used in Hubitat through ST<>HE integration ..
Only single button click actions are reported ( no double-click, no held actions :( )
When used with a Tiya zigbee hub, all works perfect... but only within Tuya cloud platform. :(
