# SmartThings

My experimental SmartThings Device Handler for the new 4 button Scene Switches 'Powered by Tuya'
When these new 'Powered by Tuya'scene swicthes are used paired to a Tiya zigbee hub, all works perfect... but only within Tuya cloud platform. :( 

Tested in SmartThings platform using ABC Manager app.

Rev 1.1 : - added 'held' and 'up_hold' (release) events decoding for the 2 right buttons (3 and 4)

Actually this DH is useful for use in SmattThings<>Hubitat integration.
